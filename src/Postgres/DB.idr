||| Open a connection to a Postgres database,
||| perform some actions with it, and then close
||| the connection.
|||
||| If the database connection is established successfully,
||| the `onOpen` function will be executed. If the
||| connection cannot be established, `onError` will be
||| executed.
|||
||| You do _not_ call `pgOpen` or `pgClose` directly
||| when using this function.
